          JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
          JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a
          small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for
          developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript
          lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can
          be connected to the objects of these environments to provide
          progammatic control over them.

        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="#">Variable Declaration</a> Javascript variables are
            containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with
            coffee. The cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All
            JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These
            unique names are called identifiers.
            <span class="sample">var x;</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="#">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign
            values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured
            in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment
            operator assigns values to variables.
            <span class="sample">var x = 10;</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="#">Data Type</a> Okay, so I am 100% done tabbing back and
            forth and typing stuff in. Instead, I will make up a bunch of things
            to put in these lines
            <span class="sample">Some Stuff</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="#">Conditionals</a> Occasionally I suffer from a
            Conditional (heh, get it?) that makes me stick 100% to what I'm
            given.
            <span class="sample">I don't have that now</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="#">Loops</a> Clearly, I am stuck in a time-loop, in which I
            write nonssense over and over and over and over and over and over
            and over and over and over and over and over and over and over.
            <span class="sample"> And then one more time.</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="#">Function</a>After putting all this text in, I can now
            say for sure that my code functions. Not that it's functional.
            Because in programming that means something completely different.
            Functional programming means you focus on creating and calling
            functions to execute tasks, as opposed to classical programming,
            where you define classes of objects, and then subclasses
            <span class="sample">etc. etc. etc.</span>
